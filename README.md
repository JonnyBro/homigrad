![Opengrad - Open Source Homigrad](https://i.imgur.com/YRvzwGZ.png)
Opengrad is an open-source alternative to Homigrad, the popular Russian gamemode.

# What is Homigirad?
Homigrad is a TTT/Murder-like gamemode that uses 'realistic' health and movement systems. There are several sub-modes that can be played, such as TDM, Deathmatch, and Hide and Seek.   

# Server Installation
We recommend that, for the time-being, you use the Workshop version at [Put here when published.]

Otherwise, if you want the bleeding edge, simply download the repository as a .zip file, and drag and drop the opengrad-main folder into your addons folder.

Once you've loaded the addon onto your server, please look into the wiki (No Link Avaiable) for further information.

# FAQ
### What language is Opengrad in?
It is currently in English, retranslated from Russian.
### Can I use this in Sandbox/TTT/etc?
No, Opengrad is its own gamemode.
### How can I customise this for my server?
We strongly advise that you DO NOT attempt to customise anything at this stage.
### Can I make my own gamemode using this codebase?
Under the MIT License, you are free to do whatever you want with this code. However, we simply ask that if you have an improvement, make a pull request!
