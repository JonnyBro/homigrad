# !! Please Read !!
This project was originally developed for a specific group of servers, which is now defunct. 

**If you are reading this, this means that this branch still has bits of code that ONLY work/make sense on that server.**
# What is Homigirad?
Homigrad is a TTT/Murder-like gamemode that uses 'realistic' health and movement systems. There are several sub-modes that can be played, such as TDM, Deathmatch, and Hide and Seek.   

# Server Installation
We recommend that, for the time-being, you use the Workshop version at [Put here when published].

Otherwise, if you want the bleeding edge, simply download the repository as a .zip file, and drag and drop the homigrad-main folder into your gamemodes folder.

Once you've loaded the addon onto your server, please look into the wiki (No Link Avaiable) for further information.
# FAQ
### What language is Homigrad in?
It is currently in English. Locales are being worked on though.
### Can I use this in Sandbox/TTT/etc?
For our movement system, please see [Link Not Available]
### How can I customise this for my server?
We strongly advise that you DO NOT attempt to customise anything at this stage.
### Can I make my own gamemode using this codebase?
Under the MIT License, you are free to do whatever you want with this code. We simply ask that if you have an improvement, please make a pull request!
