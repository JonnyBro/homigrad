## What is Homigrad?

Homigrad is a game mode inspired by Trouble in Terrorist Town (TTT) and Murder. It features a somewhat realistic health and movement system and offers several sub-modes, including Team Deathmatch (TDM), Deathmatch, and Hide and Seek.

## Installation

1. [Download the repository](https://github.com/JonnyBro/homigrad/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
2. Extract the `homigrad-main` folder and place it in your `addons` folder or server’s `addons` directory.
3. Ensure the gamemode is set to `Homigrad` (use `+gamemode homigrad` for servers).

A tickrate from **99** to **128** is recommended to improve controls when faking.

## TODO

- [ ] Move Homigrad's commands to ULX (i like ulx).
- [ ] Find and fix existing bugs (there are many to address).

## Known Bugs

- [ ] Listed as FIXME and NOTE in comments.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What language is this version in?

The game currently includes a mix of English and localized content. Full localization is planned for English, Russian, and Ukrainian.

### Can I use Homigrad's movement/weapons in other game modes (Sandbox, TTT, etc)?

The movement system and weapons from Homigrad are not directly compatible with other gamemodes. However, if you're proficient, you might explore [Harrison’s movement-addon branch](https://github.com/harrisoniam/homigrad/tree/movement-addon).

### How can I customize this for my server?

You’re free to modify the files, adjust values, and tweak the code to suit your server’s needs.

### Can I create my own gamemode using this codebase?

Yes! Just like the original repo, this project is under the MIT License, so you’re welcome to use it as a base. Contributions are also encouraged — feel free to submit pull requests here or on [Harrison's repository](https://github.com/harrisoniam/homigrad).
